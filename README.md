<a name="contentsNode"/>
## node.js usage

Install: `npm install supchik`

```javascript
    var supchik = require('supchik');

    // Compile `source.js` to `output.js`
    supchik.compile('source.js', 'output.js', {
        inputFormat: supchik.Format.FILE_CODE,
        outputFormat: supchik.Format.FILE_CODE
    });

    // Compile from source string to `output.js`
    var source = fs.readFileSync('source.js', { encoding: 'utf-8' });
    supchik.compile(source, 'output.js', {
        outputFormat: supchik.Format.FILE_CODE
    });

    // Compile from source string to generated source string
    var generatedSource = supchik.compile(source);

    // Compile from source string to generated AST
    var generatedAst = supchik.compile(source, null, {
        outputFormat: supchik.Format.AST
    });

    // Compile from AST to generated source string
    var ast = esprima.parse(source);
    generatedSource = supchik.compile(ast, null, {
        inputFormat: supchik.Format.AST
    });

    // Compile `source.js` to generated AST file
    supchik.compile('source.js', 'output.ast.json', {
        inputFormat: supchik.Format.FILE_CODE,
        outputFormat: supchik.Format.FILE_AST
    });

    // Advanced example
    var output = {};
    supchik.compile(source, output, {
        sourceMap: 'output.js.map',
        prettyPrint: true, // pretty print output
        // additional AST transformation stages
        transforms: [ '/path/to/my/transform/module' ],
        techs: { // specify techs
            js: require('/path/to/my/js/tech'),
            txt: MyTxtTech,
            custom: MyCustomExtensionTech
        },
        file: require('/path/to/my/file') // specify file system engine
    });

    output.source; // file source string
    output.ast; // generated AST
    output.sourceMap; // source map string
    output.compiledSource; // compiled source string

    // Supported input formats
    supchik.Format.FILE_CODE; // read js file
    supchik.Format.FILE_AST; // read ast json file
    supchik.Format.CODE; // string js source
    supchik.Format.AST; // ast json source

    // Supported output formats
    supchik.Format.FILE_CODE; // write js file
    supchik.Format.FILE_AST; // write ast json file
    supchik.Format.CODE; // output as js string
    supchik.Format.AST; // output as ast json
```

<a name="contentsErrorHandling">
## Error handling

One of the Supchik's goals to accurate handle errors.
It uses rich exceptions design to tell you about errors.

```javascript

    try {
        supchik.compile( ... );
    } catch(error) {
        if(error instanceof supchik.ParseError) {
            // Parse source error occured

            error.source;      // file
            error.lineNumber;  // at line number
            error.column;      // at column number
            error.description; // error's description

        } else if(error instanceof supchik.GenerateError) {
            // Generate source from AST error occured

            error.description; // error's description

        } else if(error instanceof supchik.ReadError){
            // Read file error occured

            error.source; // file

        } else if(error instanceof supchik.WriteError) {
            // Write file error occured

            error.source; // file

        } else {
            // Other error not tracked by Supchik
        }
    }

```

<a name="contentsDiffirence"/>
## Borshick JS include notations diffirence

All literal notations always escapes as include type.
Except string literal notation that always escapes strings.

```javascript

    var a = {/*borschik:include:a.json*/}; // var a = { a: true };
    var b = {/*borschik:include:b.txt*/};  // var b = 'Text from B';
    var c = 'borschik:include:c.json';     // var c = '{"c":true}';

```

All JavaScript includes must provide valid JavaScript source and must lends to AST node's body.

```javascript

    /*borschik:include:a.js*/ // ok

    /*borschik:include:a.json*/ // failed! makes source js file not valid.

    /*borschik:include:a.txt*/ // failed! makes source js file not valid.

    for(;;) {
       /*borschik:include:b.js*/ // ok
    }

    for(;/*borschik:include:b.js*/;) { // failed! makes source js file not valid.
    }

    if(true) {
       /*borschik:include:b.js*/ // ok
    } else  {
       /*borschik:include:b.js*/ // ok
    }

    if({/*borschik:include:b.js*/}) { // failed! makes source js file not valid.
    }

    function f() {
       /*borschik:include:b.js*/ // ok
    }

    function f(/*borschik:include:b.js*/) { // failed! makes source js file not valid.
    }

    var c = {/*borschik:include:c.json*/}; // ok

    var c = {/*borschik:include:c.js*/}; // failed! makes source js file not valid.

```

<a name="contentsTechs"/>
## Understanding techs

Techs role in Supchik to generate [Mozilla AST tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API) from source string. Supchik's techs must export `parse` method that accepts `source string` and returns `Mozilla AST tree`. Basic example:

```javascript
    function parse(input, options) {
        options = options || {};

        return {
            type: 'Program',
            body: [{
                type: 'Literal',
                kind: 'string',
                value: input,
                loc: {
                    range: [ 0, input.length ],
                    start: { line: 1, column: 0 },
                    end: { line: 1, column: input.length }
                    source: options.source || null
                }
            }]
        };
    }

    module.exports = {
        parse: parse
    };
```

### node.js usage:

```javascript
    ...

    var MyCustomTech = {
        parse: function(input, options) { ... }
    };

    supchik.compile(source, null, {
        techs: {
            js: require('/path/to/my/js/tech'),
            custom: MyCustomTech
        }
    });

    ...
```

<a name="contentsTransformations"/>
## Understanding transformations

Supchik's transformation allow to provide your custom AST transformation stage. Transformation must export `transfrom` method that accepts `Mozilla AST tree` and returns transformed `Mozilla AST Tree`. Basic example:

```javascript
    var estraverse = require('estraverse');

    function transform(ast, options) {
        options = options || {};

        options.sourcePath; // path to file as array: [ '/path/to/file/', '..' ]
        options.source;     // file name: ../file.js
        options.file;       // file engine
        options.techs;      // available techs
        options.transforms; // available transforms

        // Let's make all vars names forced lowercase
        estraverse.traverse(ast, {
            enter: function(node, parent) {
                if(node.type === 'Identifier') {
                    node.name = node.name.toLowerCase();
                }
            }
        });
    }

    module.exports = {
        transform: transform
    };
```

### Command line usage

```
    supchik source.js --transforms /path/to/my/transform/module,/path/to/my/other/transform/module
```

### node.js usage

```javascript
    ...

    var MyTransformModule = {
        transform: function(ast, options) { ... }
    };

    supchik.compile(source, null, {
        transforms: [ '/path/to/my/transform/module', MyTransformModule ]
    });

    ...
```
